Solving the given Sudoko

Given an incomplete Sudoku configuration in terms of a 9 x 9  2-D square matrix (grid[][]), the task is to find a solved Sudoku. For simplicity, you may assume that there will be only one unique solution.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

    Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
    Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
    Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.

Zeros in the grid indicates blanks, which are to be filled with some number between 1-9. You can not replace the element in the cell which is not blank.
